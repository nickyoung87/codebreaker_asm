Just a little idea to try and learn assembly. It is based off a game I sued to play as a kid called Mastermind where you try to guess a pattern that another player has setup.

In this one person sets up an 8 character code using 1s and 0s and then the second player tries to guess it. The program tells you if you are right or wrong in your guess with a 1 or 0 and you guess until you get it. 

I will possibly come back to make improvements as I learn more things.
